# Loan_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
<h1>Overview</h1>

The idea  is to build a model that will predict the loan approval of an applicant who has applied for a loan . It is based on the userâ€™s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments. We can build a linear model for this project.

<h2>Dataset Features</h2>
<br>Dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset
<br><br>The following are dataset feature same in train and test set only test set not contain Loan_Status we need to predict it :

<br>1.Loan_ID                           :	Unique Loan ID
<br>2.Gender	                          :  Male/ Female
<br>3.Married	Applicant                 : married (Y/N)
<br>4.Dependents	                      : Number of dependents
<br>5.Education	Applicant Education     : (Graduate/Under Graduate)
<br>6.Self_Employed                     :	Self employed (Y/N)
<br>7.ApplicantIncome	                  : Applicant income
<br>8.CoapplicantIncome	                : Coapplicant income
<br>9.LoanAmount	                      : Loan amount in thousands
<br>10.Loan_Amount_Term                 :	Term of loan in months
<br>11.Credit_History	                  : Credit history meets guidelines
<br>12.Property_Area	                  : Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural
<br>13.Loan_Status	                    : Loan approved (Y/N)

<h1>Aim:</h1>
Is to predict whether the applicant will have loan approved or not.So,we have to predict the approval.It is a supervised classification problem to be trained on train dataset and test on test set .By using algorithm like:
<ul>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>XGBoost</li>
</ul>
